        The breakpoint is stored by an ordered tuple of sites (:obj:`p_i`, :obj:`p_j`) where :obj:`p_i` defines the

        :obj:`v` has a pointer to the half edge in the doubly connected edge list of the Voronoi diagram. More
        precisely, :obj:`v` has a pointer to one of the half-edges of the edge being traced out by the breakpoint
        represented by :obj:`v`.
